### Custom Shortcuts
* Go to `Preferences > Keys`
* Add these shortcuts
.. * ctrl j -> Select pane on the bottom
.. * so on and so forth

### Importing Keybindings
*Note*: I have exported my `iterm` keybindings now in the `iterms` folder. 

* Go to `Preferences > Keys > "Presets..." > Import`
* Import `arshan_key_bindings.itermkeymap`

## ZSH

* May have to accept some X-Code terms before being able to install git. 

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
* Will have to accept two things, TODO: see if you can automate this. 

## FZF
This badboy is necessary ðŸ˜©.
